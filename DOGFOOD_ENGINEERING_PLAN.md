# DOGFOOD HACKATHON 2026 — ENGINEERING PROJECT PLAN

**Prepared for:** Hackathon Raptors  
**Project:** Dogfood — Open-Source Hackathon Submission & Judging Platform  
**Duration:** 72 hours (September 25–28, 2026)  
**Classification:** Production Software Engineering Plan  
**Status:** Pre-Implementation Planning  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dogfood is not a hackathon feature project. It is a production software engineering effort constrained to a 72-hour completion window.

The challenge is to build a **real platform that Hackathon Raptors can immediately adopt and operate**, complete with:

- Secure, backend-enforced role isolation
- Transparent, defensible judging and normalization
- Community voting with abuse prevention
- Self-hostable, local-first deployment
- Complete documentation and operational readiness

**Success criteria** is not feature count but **correctness, integrity, maintainability, and adoptability**.

A smaller but correct T2 implementation is worth more than a broken T4.

---

## 1. PRODUCT DEFINITION

### 1.1 What We Are Building

A **self-hostable, open-source platform for managing the complete lifecycle of a hackathon event**, from registration through results publication and archival.

The product serves:

1. **Event Organizers** — who create and manage events, assign judges, configure rubrics, monitor progress
2. **Judges** — who score projects according to configurable criteria
3. **Participants** — who register, form teams, and submit projects
4. **Community** — who vote on projects and comment
5. **Admins** — who configure system-wide policies

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Existing hackathon platforms suffer from:

- Weak separation of concerns (judges can see peer scores)
- Opaque score normalization (averaging raw scores is insufficient)
- Vulnerable community voting (no abuse prevention)
- Cloud/hosted dependencies (lock-in, operational complexity)
- Poor data portability (spreadsheet-driven workarounds)
- Limited API coverage (no programmatic access)
- Insufficient documentation (difficult to operate independently)

Dogfood addresses these gaps through:

- **Backend-enforced authorization** at the API level
- **Transparent, documented normalization** with mathematical justification
- **Rate limiting, duplicate detection, and audit trails** for voting
- **Local-first, self-hosted architecture** with no external dependencies
- **Complete data export/import** for portability
- **Comprehensive REST API** for programmatic access
- **Clear operational documentation** for adoption

### 1.3 Event Lifecycle

A complete event progression:

```
DRAFT
  ↓
REGISTRATION_OPEN  (participants register, form teams)
  ↓
REGISTRATION_CLOSED (team formation locked)
  ↓
SUBMISSION_OPEN  (participants submit projects)
  ↓
SUBMISSION_CLOSED  (submissions locked)
  ↓
ELIGIBILITY_REVIEW  (organizers verify submissions)
  ↓
JUDGING  (judges score projects)
  ↓
JUDGING_COMPLETE  (all scoring finished)
  ↓
VOTING  (community votes on projects)
  ↓
VOTING_CLOSED  (ballots locked)
  ↓
RESULTS  (rankings published)
  ↓
CERTIFICATES  (documents issued)
  ↓
ARCHIVED  (event closed)
```

### 1.4 System Boundaries

**Inside:**
- User authentication and session management
- Event lifecycle state machine
- Team and submission management
- Judging interface and score recording
- Judge assignment algorithms
- Score normalization
- Community voting system
- Public gallery and search
- CSV/data export
- REST API

**Outside:**
- Email delivery (teams send invites, receive notifications via UI)
- Cloud storage (files are base64-embedded or served locally)
- Third-party authentication (LDAP, OAuth)
- Analytics or telemetry
- Video hosting (stored as URLs, not transcoded)
- CDN or edge caching
- AI/ML model serving

### 1.5 Primary Actors & Permissions

| Actor | Registration | Submission | Judging | Voting | Results | Admin |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Visitor** | View | View | — | Vote* | View | — |

## 4. DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

### 4.1 Incremental Software Engineering

We reject the "build everything first, test at the end" anti-pattern.

Instead:

```

     ↓
Architecture & Tech Stack
     ↓
Database Schema
     ↓
Authentication Foundation
     ↓

     ↓
T1 Freeze & Full Testing
     ↓
T2 — Judging (incremental)
     ↓
T2 Freeze & Full Testing
     ↓
T3 — Public (incremental)
     ↓
T3 Freeze & Full Testing

```

### 4.2 Dependency Graph

     │
Final Phase
     ├─→ Integration Testing
     ├─→ Security Audit
     ├─→ Acceptance Suite
     ├─→ Documentation
```

### 4.3 Quality Gates Between Tiers

A tier is **not complete** until:

1. **All requirements implemented** (no stubbed features)
2. **All tests passing** (unit + integration + acceptance)
3. **Authorization verified** (role isolation tested at API level)
4. **Stable schema** (no major migrations from this tier onward)
5. **Documentation updated** (README reflects tier capabilities)
6. **Seed data supports it** (dev/test data includes this tier's workflows)

**Do not advance to T2 if T1 is unstable.**

**Do not advance to T3 if T2 judging is broken.**

**Production**
- PostgreSQL (if needed for scale; not required for hackathon)

**Recommendation: SQLite for hackathon, PostgreSQL-compatible schema**

Rationale:
- SQLite has no external dependencies
- Runs on single laptop
- Easy to backup (copy file)
- Schema is compatible with PostgreSQL for future migration

**Session/Cache**
- In-memory store (for hackathon, rate limiting and dedup)
- Upgrade to Redis if needed post-hackathon

**Authentication**
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Session cookies (httpOnly, Secure flags)
- No external OAuth provider

## 6. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 6.1 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

#### **ADR-001: Monolithic Backend vs Microservices**

**Decision:** Monolithic backend

**Context:**
- 72-hour deadline
- Small team (1–4 people)
- Operational simplicity required (self-hosted on laptop)
- High coupling between judging, submission, and voting

**Options:**
1. Monolith (API + business logic + data access in single process)
2. Microservices (auth, judging, voting, export as separate services)

**Chosen:** Monolith

**Why:**
- Faster development
- Single deployment artifact
- Simpler data consistency (transactions)
- Easier debugging
- Meets self-hostability requirement
- Can be refactored later if needed

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower horizontal scalability (acceptable; hackathon is single-event)
- Coupling between domains
- Single point of failure (mitigated by backups)

**Consequences:**
- Can deploy with one Docker container
- Database and API in same deployment
- Transactions simplify score atomicity

---

#### **ADR-002: Database Choice (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)**

**Decision:** SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-compatible schema for portability

**Context:**
- No external services allowed
- Must run on laptop with network disabled
- Operational simplicity critical
- Future adoption by Raptors may require scale

**Options:**
1. SQLite (embedded, file-based)
2. PostgreSQL (requires separate server)
3. MySQL (similar to PostgreSQL)

**Chosen:** SQLite in-process, PostgreSQL schema compatibility

**Why:**
- SQLite is zero-config, embedded
- No separate database process
- File-based backup (copy to new machine)
- Schema is compatible with PostgreSQL (use standard SQL, avoid SQLite-specific syntax)
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL later without schema changes

**Trade-offs:**
- SQLite is not concurrent (acceptable; typical hackathon judges are sequential)
- Fewer advanced features (acceptable for MVP)
- Data file must be persisted as Docker volume

**Consequences:**
- Use ORM that supports both (Prisma, SQLAlchemy)
- Avoid SQLite-specific features
- Must persist data volume in docker-compose.yml

---

#### **ADR-003: Authentication Strategy (Sessions vs JWT)**

**Decision:** Session-based authentication with httpOnly cookies

**Context:**
- No external auth provider
- Simple, secure, widely understood
- Easier to invalidate (important for security)
- Easier for traditional web apps

**Options:**
1. Session cookies (httpOnly, Secure)
2. JWT tokens (stateless, refresh tokens needed)
3. Combined (session + JWT for API clients)

**Chosen:** Session cookies for web, optional JWT for API clients

**Why:**
- Session cookies are simpler (no token refresh logic)
- httpOnly prevents XSS token theft
- Session revocation is immediate
- Easier to invalidate on password change
- Standard web security practice

**Trade-offs:**
- Server-side session storage required
- Less suitable for distributed systems (acceptable; we're monolithic)
- Harder for mobile clients (can add JWT layer later)

**Consequences:**
- Use session middleware (Express session)
- Store sessions in database or in-memory
- Set Secure + SameSite flags on cookies
- Implement session expiry (typically 7 days)

---

#### **ADR-004: Authorization Enforcement (Middleware vs Decorator vs Explicit)**

**Decision:** Middleware + explicit checks in route handlers

**Context:**
- Role isolation is critical (judges cannot see peer scores)
- Enforcement must be backend-only
- Cannot rely on frontend to enforce permissions

**Options:**
1. Middleware-only (check role, not resource ownership)
2. Decorators on endpoints (e.g., @authorize('judge'))
3. Explicit checks in handler (if (user.role !== 'organizer') throw 403)
4. Combined (middleware for basic role, handler for resource ownership)

**Chosen:** Combined approach

**Why:**
- Middleware provides basic role check (fail fast)
- Handler checks resource ownership (e.g., can this judge see this project?)
- Prevents unauthorized access at multiple layers
- Clear in code what is being authorized

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more verbose
- Risk of forgetting to check (mitigated by tests)

**Consequences:**
- Write authorization tests for every sensitive endpoint
- Use audit logging to catch authorization failures
- Document authorization model clearly

---

#### **ADR-005: Score Normalization Method**

**Decision:** Z-score normalization with clip to [0, 5] range

**Context:**
- Different judges may use different scoring ranges
- Some judges might give all 5s; others all 3s
- Must be transparent and reproducible

**Options:**
1. Average raw scores (weak; doesn't account for judge bias)
2. Z-score normalization (transforms to mean=0, std=1)
3. Percentile-based (rank by percentile)
4. Bayesian (assumes judge bias distribution)
5. Bradley-Terry (pairwise comparisons)

**Chosen:** Z-score normalization

**Why:**
- Mathematically sound
- Reproducible
- Transparent (can show before/after)
- Handles judge bias (high-scoring or low-scoring judges are normalized)
- Not overly complex (implementable in 72 hours)

**Trade-offs:**
- Assumes normal distribution (reasonable for scores)
- Can create scores outside [1, 5] range (must clip)
- Requires sufficient samples (minimum 2-3 judges per project)

**Consequences:**
- Document formula: `z_score = (x - mean) / std_dev`, then map to [0, 5] range
- Include before/after in CSV export
- Show ranking changes to organizers
- Produce visualization of distribution

---

#### **ADR-006: Voting Abuse Prevention Method**

**Decision:** Multi-layer detection: rate limiting + duplicate detection + audit trail

**Context:**
- Community voting can be manipulated
- Need to catch sybil voting, ballot stuffing
- Must be transparent (organizers can see suspicious activity)

**Options:**
1. Rate limiting only (simple but incomplete)
2. Duplicate detection only (weak)
3. CAPTCHA (adds friction, not suitable for hackathon)
4. Multi-layer (rate limiting + duplicate + audit)
5. Voting from verified email only (strong but high friction)

**Chosen:** Multi-layer approach

**Why:**
- Rate limiting catches rapid-fire voting
- Duplicate detection catches multiple votes from same source
- Audit trail enables investigation
- Transparent to organizers (can see suspicious patterns)
- No friction on legitimate voters

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex than single check
- Requires audit infrastructure

**Consequences:**
- Implement rate limiter: 10 votes per hour per IP
- Track votes by IP, user ID, cookie
- Log all votes in audit table
- Provide organizer dashboard showing suspicious patterns

---

#### **ADR-007: Judge Assignment Algorithm**

**Decision:** Greedy even distribution with track constraint

**Context:**
- Projects need multiple judges
- Judges assigned to specific tracks
- Distribution should be balanced (no judge overloaded)

**Options:**
1. Manual assignment (UI, organizer clicks)
2. Random assignment (simple but unbalanced)
3. Round-robin (balanced but predictable)
4. Greedy even distribution (balanced, respects constraints)
5. Optimization algorithm (most fair but complex)

**Chosen:** Manual + greedy batch algorithm

**Why:**
- Manual UI for small hackathons
- Batch greedy for large-scale events
- Balanced distribution
- Respects track constraints
- Transparent to organizers

**Trade-offs:**
- Not optimal (but good enough)
- Requires at least 3 judges per project (assumption)

**Consequences:**
- Provide manual assignment UI (drag-drop or checkbox)
- Provide batch algorithm: sort projects by current judge count, assign judges in round-robin
- Ensure judges are not assigned outside their track
- Verify all projects have minimum judges assigned

---

#### **ADR-008: Audit Logging Strategy**

**Decision:** Immutable append-only audit log with structured JSON

**Context:**
- Must track sensitive actions (score changes, voting, judge access)
- Organizers need to understand voting patterns
- Must be forensic-grade (tamper-evident)

**Options:**
1. No audit log (risk; cannot investigate issues)
2. Mutable logs (can be altered; not forensic)
3. Immutable append-only (cannot be changed)
4. Database-only (depends on database security)
5. Immutable + cryptographic signatures (blockchain-like, probably overkill)

**Chosen:** Immutable append-only logs with structured JSON

**Why:**
- All actions recorded (login, score change, vote, access)
- Cannot be tampered with (append-only)
- Queryable (JSON structure)
- Transparent to organizers

**Trade-offs:**
- Log storage grows (acceptable)
- More complex (mitigated by ORM)

**Consequences:**
- Create audit_log table with immutable fields
- Log to audit_log on: login, score submission, vote, access to sensitive data
- Include: timestamp, user, action, resource, result, IP/session
- Provide query UI for organizers to explore logs
- Export logs with results

---

#### **ADR-009: Judge Score Immutability**

**Decision:** Scores are final once submitted; cannot be edited by judge

**Context:**
- Audit trail requires immutability
- Prevents after-the-fact manipulation
- Clear audit trail

**Options:**
1. Scores can be edited indefinitely (poor audit trail)
2. Scores locked after submission (immutable)
3. Scores can be edited, with audit trail (complex)

**Chosen:** Scores are final once submitted

**Why:**
- Simplest to implement
- Clearest audit trail
- Prevents accidental/intentional modification

**Trade-offs:**
- Judges cannot correct mistakes (mitigated: require organizer to reset)

**Consequences:**
- Implement score version history (optional): show previous scores if reset
- Provide UI for organizers to reset a judge's scores
- Log all resets

---

#### **ADR-010: Track Isolation Implementation**

**Decision:** Track field on Judge, filtered in queries

**Context:**
- Judges assigned to one or more tracks
- Cannot access projects in other tracks
- Must be enforced at query level

**Options:**
1. Track field on Judge table
2. Separate JudgeTrack join table (flexible)
3. Authorization check in handler (incomplete)

**Chosen:** JudgeTrack join table with query filtering

**Why:**
- Supports judges assigned to multiple tracks
- Easy to query in handler: "projects where judge.tracks contains project.track"
- Flexible for future multi-track scenarios

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more complex schema
- Join required in queries

**Consequences:**
- Create JudgeTrack table (judge_id, track_id)
- Filter all project queries by judge's assigned tracks
- Test that judge cannot access other-track projects via direct URL/API

### 8.2 Key Constraints & Integrity

**Unique Constraints**
- `users(email)` — prevent duplicate registrations
- `events(slug)` — prevent duplicate event URLs
- `team_members(team_id, user_id)` — prevent duplicate team membership
- `judges(event_id, user_id)` — one judge role per user per event
- `judge_tracks(judge_id, track_id)` — prevent duplicate track assignment
- `judge_assignments(judge_id, submission_id)` — prevent duplicate assignment
- `scores(judge_id, submission_id, criterion_id)` — one score per criterion per judge

**Foreign Key Constraints**
- Cascade deletes on: sessions, team_members, teams, submissions, judges, judge_assignments, scores, votes, comments, certificates (event deletion removes all)
- Restrict deletes on: organizer_id (user), judge.user_id (user), owner_id (user) to prevent orphaning

**Nullable Fields**
- `sessions.session_id` — tracks optional
- `teams.description` — optional
- `submissions.thumbnail_url`, demo_url, repo_url, video_url — optional
- `judges.accepted_at`, scoring_bias — calculated
- `judge_assignments.started_at`, completed_at — calculated
- `scores.comment` — optional
- `votes.voter_id` — nullable for anonymous voting
- `vote_audits.organizer_notes` — optional review notes
- `comments.parent_comment_id` — optional for threading
- `certificates.rank` — only for winner certs

**State/Status Fields** (enforce via application, not DB)
- `events.status` — application must enforce valid transitions
- `submissions.status` — application must enforce deadline-based transitions
- `judges.status` — application manages lifecycle
- `judge_assignments.status` — application tracks progress
- `votes.status` (implicit) — immutable after creation

**Immutable Records**
- `audit_logs` — append-only, never updated
- `scores` — once `submitted_at` is set, cannot be modified (soft constraint in app)
- `votes` — immutable after creation

---

### 8.3 Indexing Strategy

**High-Priority Indexes** (for common queries)
- `users(email)` — login queries
- `events(slug, status)` — event lookups
- `submissions(event_id, track_id, status)` — filtering submissions
- `judges(event_id, status)` — judge progress queries
- `judge_assignments(judge_id, status)` — judge's pending work
- `scores(submission_id, judge_id)` — score aggregation
- `votes(event_id, submission_id, ip_address, voter_id)` — vote deduplication & rate limiting
- `audit_logs(user_id, action, timestamp)` — forensic queries

**Avoid Over-Indexing**
- Skip indexes on low-cardinality fields (e.g., `role`, `status`) unless regularly filtered
- Monitor index usage post-launch

**Invalid Transitions**
- Cannot skip states (must progress linearly)
- Cannot revert (ARCHIVED is terminal)
- Cannot transition before timestamp if auto-triggered

**Enforcement**
- Application validates state before action
- Database constraint: status field limited to enum values
- Audit log: every state change logged

         ├──→ organizer.mark_eligible() ──→ ELIGIBLE
         └──→ organizer.disqualify()  ──→ DISQUALIFIED
```

**Deadline Enforcement**
- After `submission_end` timestamp: `DRAFT` → `SUBMITTED` transition blocked
- Editing locked after submission (application check)

**Invalid Transitions**
- Cannot edit after submitted
- Cannot unsubmit
- Cannot transition from DISQUALIFIED

---

### 9.3 Judge Assignment Lifecycle

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│         PENDING              │

└──────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 9.4 Voting Access Control

During `VOTING` state:
- **Participants**: Cannot see live vote totals (results hidden)
- **Judges**: Can vote (treated as participants)
- **Organizers**: Can see live vote totals in admin dashboard
- **Visitors**: Can vote if voting_mode allows

During `RESULTS` state:
- **All**: Can see final vote totals

---

## 10. SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### 10.1 Authentication

**Implementation**
- Passwords hashed with Bcrypt (12 rounds minimum) or Argon2
- Email verification on registration (optional but recommended)
- Sessions stored in database with secure cookie flags

```
Registration Request
  ↓
Validate email/password
  ↓
Hash password
  ↓
Create user record
  ↓
Send verification email (optional)
  ↓
User confirmed
```

**Session Management**
- Session ID: 32-byte random token
- Stored in database with user_id, expires_at, ip_address, user_agent
- Cookie flags: `HttpOnly=true`, `Secure=true` (HTTPS), `SameSite=Strict`
- Session expiry: 7 days for most users; 1 day for judges (security)
- Session invalidation on logout: delete from database

**Password Reset**
- User requests reset via email
- Generate one-time reset token (valid 1 hour)
- Email link with token
- User sets new password
- Token invalidated

---

### 10.2 Authorization (RBAC)

**Role Hierarchy**

```
ADMIN
  ├─ All permissions
  └─ System-wide access

ORGANIZER
  ├─ Create/edit own events
  ├─ Invite judges
  ├─ Configure rubrics
  ├─ View all scores (own event)
  ├─ Publish results
  └─ Issue certificates

JUDGE
  ├─ Accept/decline invitations
  ├─ View assigned projects
  ├─ Submit scores
  └─ View own scores (NOT peers)

PARTICIPANT
  ├─ Create teams
  ├─ Invite teammates
  ├─ Submit projects
  └─ View own submissions

VISITOR
  └─ View public gallery
  └─ Vote (if enabled)
```

**Permission Matrix**

| Resource | ADMIN | ORG | JUDGE | PARTICIPANT | VISITOR |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Create Event | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Manage Event | ✓ | own | — | — | — |
| Invite Judge | ✓ | own | — | — | — |
| View Scores (own judge) | ✓ | own | ✓ | — | — |
| View Scores (peer judge) | ✓ | own | ✗ | — | — |
| View Scores (all) | ✓ | own | — | — | — |
| Publish Results | ✓ | own | — | — | — |
| Create Submission | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Edit Submission (before deadline) | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Vote | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View Public Gallery | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Enforcement Mechanism**

Every API endpoint enforces authorization:

```javascript
// Example: GET /api/submissions/:id
async function getSubmission(req, res) {
  const submission = await db.submission.findUnique({ id: req.params.id });
  
  // Authorization check
  const authorized =
    req.user.role === 'ADMIN' ||
    (req.user.role === 'ORGANIZER' && submission.event.organizer_id === req.user.id) ||
    (req.user.role === 'JUDGE' && canJudgeAccessSubmission(req.user, submission)) ||
    (req.user.role === 'PARTICIPANT' && submission.team.owner_id === req.user.id) ||
    (submission.status === 'ELIGIBLE' && req.user.role === 'VISITOR');
  
  if (!authorized) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  }
  
  res.json(submission);
}
```

---

### 10.3 Judge Isolation

**Backend Enforcement (Critical)**

Judge A must NOT be able to access Judge B's scores via:
1. Direct API call
2. URL manipulation
3. ID guessing
4. Authorization bypass

**Implementation**

```javascript
// Check 1: Verify judge owns this score
const score = await db.score.findUnique({ id: scoreId });
if (score.judge_id !== req.user.judge.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}

// Check 2: Verify judge is assigned to this project
const assignment = await db.judgeAssignment.findUnique({
  judge_id: req.user.judge.id,
  submission_id: score.submission_id
});
if (!assignment) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}

// Check 3: Verify judge is assigned to the project's track
const isInTrack = await db.judgeTrack.findUnique({
  judge_id: req.user.judge.id,
  track_id: score.submission.track_id
});
if (!isInTrack) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}

// ✓ All checks pass; allow access
```

**API Endpoints Requiring Judge Isolation**
- `GET /api/judges/:id/scores` — only own scores
- `GET /api/judges/:id/assignments` — only own assignments
- `GET /api/scores/:id` — only own scores
- `PATCH /api/scores/:id` — only own scores (prevent edit after submit)

**Test Cases**
- Judge A tries to access Judge B's score → 403 Forbidden
- Judge A tries to access submission outside their track → 403 Forbidden
- Judge tries to modify peer's score → 403 Forbidden
- Judge tries to list all scores → 403 Forbidden (shows only own)

---

### 10.4 Track Isolation

**Implementation**

```javascript
// When fetching projects for a judge
const projects = await db.submission.findMany({
  where: {
    track: {
      judgeTrack: {
        some: { judge_id: req.user.judge.id }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Test**
- Judge assigned to Track A tries to score project in Track B → 403 Forbidden

---

### 10.5 Voting Security

**Rate Limiting**

```javascript
// Check rate limit: max 10 votes per hour per IP
const recentVotes = await db.vote.count({
  where: {
    ip_address: req.ip,
    voted_at: { gte: Date.now() - 3600000 } // last hour
  }
});

if (recentVotes >= 10) {
  audit.logSuspiciousActivity('RATE_LIMIT', req.ip, 'Too many votes');
  return res.status(429).json({ error: 'Rate limited' });
}
```

**Duplicate Detection**

```javascript
// Check if this voter already voted on this submission
const existingVote = await db.vote.findFirst({
  where: {
    submission_id: req.body.submission_id,
    [req.user ? 'voter_id' : 'ip_address']: req.user ? req.user.id : req.ip
  }
});

if (existingVote) {
  audit.logSuspiciousActivity('DUPLICATE', req.ip, 'Duplicate vote attempt');
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Already voted' });
}
```

**Audit Trail**

```javascript
// Log every vote
await db.vote.create({
  event_id: eventId,
  submission_id: submissionId,
  voter_id: req.user?.id,
  voter_email: req.body.email,
  ip_address: req.ip,
  user_agent: req.headers['user-agent'],
  voted_at: new Date()
});

// Log suspicious activity
if (suspiciousPattern(req.ip, req.user?.id)) {
  await db.voteAudit.create({
    event_id: eventId,
    detection_type: 'SUSPICIOUS',
    severity: 'HIGH',
    ip_address: req.ip,
    voter_id: req.user?.id,
    message: 'Voting pattern suggests coordinated activity'
  });
}
```

---

### 10.6 Submission Security

**Deadline Enforcement**

```javascript
// Before allowing edit
const event = await db.event.findUnique({ id: submission.event_id });
if (new Date() > event.submission_end) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Submission deadline passed' });
}

// Before allowing submit
if (new Date() > event.submission_end) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Submission deadline passed' });
}
```

**Ownership Verification**

```javascript
// Only team members can edit their submission
const teamMember = await db.teamMember.findFirst({
  where: {
    team_id: submission.team_id,
    user_id: req.user.id
  }
});

if (!teamMember) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not a team member' });
}
```

**URL Validation**

```javascript
// Validate URLs are actually URLs
if (submission.repository_url) {
  if (!submission.repository_url.startsWith('http')) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid repository URL' });
  }
}
```

---

### 10.7 Audit Logging

Every sensitive action logged:

```javascript
await db.auditLog.create({
  user_id: req.user?.id,
  ip_address: req.ip,
  session_id: req.sessionID,
  action: 'SUBMIT_SCORE',
  resource_type: 'Score',
  resource_id: score.id,
  details: {
    judge_id: score.judge_id,
    submission_id: score.submission_id,
    score: score.score
  },
  result: 'SUCCESS'
});
```

## 15. TESTING STRATEGY

Testing is not a final phase; it runs parallel to development.

### 15.1 Unit Tests

**Scope:** Business logic, no database

**Coverage**
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based permission checks
- Scoring calculations (z-score normalization)
- Weight validation
- Deadline enforcement
- Rate limiting logic

**Tools**
- Jest (Node.js)

describe('Normalization', () => {
  test('z-score normalization calculates correctly', () => {
    const scores = [3, 4, 5, 3, 4];
    const mean = 3.8;
    const stdDev = 0.84;
    
    const normalized = normalizeZScore(scores);
    
    expect(normalized[0]).toBeCloseTo(-0.95, 1);
  });
  
  test('weights sum to 100%', () => {
    const rubric = {
      criteria: [
        { name: 'Tech', weight: 0.4 },
        { name: 'Innovation', weight: 0.25 },
        { name: 'Usability', weight: 0.2 },
        { name: 'Impact', weight: 0.15 }
      ]
    };
    
    const total = rubric.criteria.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.weight, 0);
    expect(total).toBe(1.0);
  });
});
```

### 15.2 Integration Tests

**Scope:** Components interacting with database

**Coverage**

```typescript
// test/api.test.ts
describe('Judge Isolation', () => {
  test('Judge A cannot access Judge B scores', async () => {
    const judgeA = await createUser('judge-a@test.com');
    const judgeB = await createUser('judge-b@test.com');
    const submission = await createSubmission();
    
    // Assign both judges to same submission
    await assignJudge(judgeA, submission);
    await assignJudge(judgeB, submission);
    
    // Judge B scores submission
    const score = await judgeB.post('/api/scores', {
      submission_id: submission.id,
      criterion_id: 'criterion-1',
      score: 5
    });
    
    // Judge A tries to access score
    const response = await judgeA.get(`/api/scores/${score.id}`);
    expect(response.status).toBe(403);
  });
});
```

### 15.3 End-to-End Tests

**Scope:** Complete workflows from UI

**Coverage**
- Register → Create Event → Form Team → Submit → Browse Gallery

```

### 15.4 Security Tests

**Coverage**
- Judge score isolation (API-level)
- Track isolation
- Voting duplicate detection
- Rate limiting
- Session expiry
- Password reset
- Authorization on every endpoint

**Example**

```typescript
// test/security.test.ts
describe('Authorization', () => {
  test('Visitor cannot create event', async () => {
    const visitor = { role: 'VISITOR' };
    const response = await createEvent(visitor, { name: 'Hacked' });
    expect(response.status).toBe(403);
  });
  
  test('Judge cannot vote twice', async () => {
    const judge = await createUser('judge@test.com');
    const submission = await createSubmission();
    
    await judge.post('/api/votes', { submission_id: submission.id });
    const second = await judge.post('/api/votes', { submission_id: submission.id });
    
    expect(second.status).toBe(400);
    expect(second.body.error).toContain('already voted');
  });
});
```

### 15.5 Acceptance Tests

**Scope:** Validation against acceptance suite requirements

```
feat: Add judge isolation middleware
fix: Correct z-score normalization edge case
refactor: Simplify authorization check
test: Add judge isolation tests
docs: Update JUDGING.md with normalization details
chore: Update dependencies
```

---

### 17.3 Pull Request Process

1. Create PR from feature branch to develop
2. Self-review + code review (if team > 1)
3. Run tests locally: `npm test`
4. Ensure acceptance suite passes
5. Merge to develop
6. Verify develop branch health

---

### 17.4 Definition of Done (Per Feature)

- [ ] Code written and self-reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Authorization verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Database changes migrated
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] UI is usable (if frontend)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Seed data reflects feature
- [ ] Acceptance tests pass
- [ ] No critical security issues
- [ ] Merged to develop

---

### 17.5 Code Review Checklist

- Does code match architecture?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling present?
- Are authorization checks in place?
- Are database queries efficient?
- Is code testable?
- Is it documented?

---

## 18. FRONTEND / UX STRATEGY

### 18.1 UX Principles

The interface should feel:

**Technical & Intentional**
- Avoid "AI SaaS" clichés (glassmorphism, purple gradients)
- Clear hierarchy, strong typography
- Meaningful spacing and alignment

**Trustworthy**
- Honest error messages
- Clear feedback (form validation, save confirmation)
- Transparent process (show deadlines, status)

**Efficient**
- Minimal clicks to accomplish tasks
- Keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
- Fast interactions (< 200ms response)

**Accessible**
- WCAG AA compliance
- Semantic HTML
- Color contrast

---

### 18.2 Key Surfaces

**Public Gallery**
- Browse projects
- Search and filter
- Project detail (images, description, links)
- Vote (if enabled)
- Comments

**Authentication**
- Registration form
- Login form
- Password reset
- Session timeout

**Participant Dashboard**
- My teams
- My submissions (draft, submitted)
- Invitation status
- Voting interface

**Judge Dashboard**
- Assigned projects
- Scoring interface (rubric form)
- Scoring progress
- Submit scores

**Organizer Dashboard**
- Event overview (timeline, status)
- Judge progress (% complete)
- Submission review
- Assignment interface
- Results preview
- Normalization results
- Voting activity
- Export buttons

**Admin**
- User management
- System configuration
- Audit logs (organizer only)

---

### 18.3 Design System (Minimal)

**Typography**
- Headings: Clean, sans-serif (Inter, system font)
- Body: Legible, 14-16px
- Mono: For code, timestamps

**Colors**
- Neutral palette (grays)
- Accent for primary actions (blue or green)
- Red for destructive actions
- No unnecessary decorative colors

**Spacing**
- Consistent 8px or 16px grid
- Adequate whitespace

**Components**
- Forms (text, select, checkbox, radio)
- Buttons (primary, secondary, danger)
- Cards (submissions, results)
- Tables (scores, assignments, exports)
- Modals (confirmations)

**Layout**
- Responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Fixed header/sidebar for navigation
- Main content area

---

### 18.4 Frontend Stack

**Recommendation: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite**

**Why**
- React: Large ecosystem, many developers familiar
- TypeScript: Catches bugs early
- Tailwind: Utility-first CSS, fast styling
- Vite: Fast dev server, fast builds

**Alternatives**
- SvelteKit (more opinionated, faster to write)
- Vue + Vite (similar to React, smaller ecosystem)

**State Management**
- React Context (small app)
- TanStack Query (data fetching)
- No Redux needed (unless heavy real-time updates)

**Data Fetching**
- TanStack Query (SWR alternative)
- Handles caching, refetching, error states

---

### 18.5 Accessibility Considerations

- ARIA labels on form inputs
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Alt text on images
- Form validation messages
- Skip navigation links

---

## 19. OPERATIONAL & DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### 19.1 Docker Architecture

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      DATABASE_URL: sqlite:./data/dogfood.db
      SESSION_SECRET: ${SESSION_SECRET:-dev-secret-change-in-prod}
      JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET:-dev-secret-change-in-prod}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data  # Persist SQLite database
    depends_on:
      - db  # Optional: if using PostgreSQL
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

  # Optional: PostgreSQL for production
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: dogfood
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-dev-password}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    profiles:
      - postgres

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  data:
```

**Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# Copy source
COPY . .

# Build frontend
RUN npm run build

# Seed database on startup
RUN npm run migrate:deploy && npm run seed

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 19.2 Local Deployment

```bash
# One command to run
docker compose up

# Or with seed data reset
docker compose down -v && docker compose up

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### 19.3 Environment Variables

**.env.example**

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/dogfood.db
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dogfood

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here

# App
NODE_ENV=development
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (optional)
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=1025

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 19.4 Startup Sequence

1. **Dockerfile entrypoint runs:**
   - Install deps
   - Build frontend
   - Run migrations (schema creation)
   - Seed database with fixture data
   - Start server

2. **Server startup:**
   - Connect to database
   - Initialize session store
   - Start Express server
   - Log "Ready on port 3000"

3. **Health check:**
   - Docker monitors /health endpoint
   - Container restart if unhealthy (after 3 retries)

### 19.5 Backup & Restore

**SQLite Backup**
```bash
# Backup
docker cp dogfood-app-1:/app/data/dogfood.db ./backup.db

# Restore
docker cp ./backup.db dogfood-app-1:/app/data/dogfood.db
```

**PostgreSQL Backup** (if used)
```bash
# Backup
docker exec dogfood-db-1 pg_dump -U postgres dogfood > backup.sql

# Restore
docker exec -i dogfood-db-1 psql -U postgres dogfood < backup.sql
```

### 19.6 Operations Checklist

- [ ] `docker compose up` starts cleanly
- [ ] Seed data present and correct
- [ ] All services healthy
- [ ] No external network calls required
- [ ] Data persists across restarts
- [ ] Logs are accessible
- [ ] Error handling graceful (no 500 without logging)

---

## 20. SEED DATA STRATEGY

### 20.1 Fixture Data

**Development seed data includes:**

```javascript
// seedData.ts
const seedData = {
  users: [
    { id: 'user-admin', email: 'admin@test.com', password, role: 'ADMIN' },
    { id: 'user-org', email: 'organizer@test.com', password, role: 'ORGANIZER' },
    { id: 'judge-1', email: 'judge1@test.com', password, role: 'JUDGE' },
    { id: 'judge-2', email: 'judge2@test.com', password, role: 'JUDGE' },
    { id: 'judge-3', email: 'judge3@test.com', password, role: 'JUDGE' },
    { id: 'participant-1', email: 'participant1@test.com', password, role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
    // ... 10 more participants
  ],
  
  events: [
    {
      id: 'event-1',
      name: 'Test Hackathon 2026',
      organizer_id: 'user-org',
      status: 'JUDGING',
      registration_start: '2026-09-01',
      submission_start: '2026-09-10',
      judging_start: '2026-09-20',
      // ...
    }
  ],
  
  tracks: [
    { id: 'track-1', event_id: 'event-1', name: 'Web' },
    { id: 'track-2', event_id: 'event-1', name: 'Mobile' },
    { id: 'track-3', event_id: 'event-1', name: 'AI/ML' }
  ],
  
  teams: [
    { id: 'team-1', event_id: 'event-1', name: 'Team Alpha', owner_id: 'participant-1' },
    // ... 10 more teams
  ],
  
  submissions: [
    { id: 'sub-1', team_id: 'team-1', track_id: 'track-1', 
      name: 'WebApp Project', status: 'ELIGIBLE' },
    // ... 20-30 submissions across tracks
  ],
  
  judges: [
    { id: 'judge-1', event_id: 'event-1', user_id: 'judge-1', status: 'ACCEPTED' },
    // ... all judges
  ],
  
  judgeAssignments: [
    { id: 'ja-1', judge_id: 'judge-1', submission_id: 'sub-1' },
    // ... 60-90 assignments (3 judges per submission)
  ],
  
  scores: [
    { id: 'score-1', judge_id: 'judge-1', submission_id: 'sub-1', 
      criterion_id: 'crit-1', score: 4 },
    // ... complete scoring across all submissions
  ]
};
```

### 20.2 Seed Script

```bash
# npm run seed

# Clears database and loads fixture data
# Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
# Creates known users with deterministic passwords for testing
```

### 20.3 Deterministic Credentials

For development/testing:

```
Admin: admin@test.com / password
Organizer: organizer@test.com / password
Judge1: judge1@test.com / password
Participant1: participant1@test.com / password
```

**Important:** These are ONLY for development. Production uses random passwords.

## 24. CRITICAL PATH

**Dependencies that can block entire project:**

```
Database Schema
  ↓
Authentication
  ↓
Authorization / RBAC
  ↓
Event Management
  ↓
Submission Lifecycle
  ├─→ Team Formation (parallel)
  ├─→ Public Gallery (parallel)
  │
  ↓
Judge Assignment
  ↓
Judging Interface
  ├→ Judge Isolation (CRITICAL)
  │
  ↓
Score Normalization
  ↓
Voting Infrastructure
  ├→ Rate Limiting

Results Publication
  ├→ Hidden Results
  │
  ↓
Data Export

  ├─→ Webhooks (optional)
  ├─→ Certificates (optional)
  │
  ↓
Integration & Testing
  ↓
Acceptance Suite
  ↓
Documentation & Release
```

**If database schema breaks:** All downstream work blocked (HIGH RISK)  
**If auth breaks:** Cannot test anything (HIGH RISK)  
**If judge isolation breaks:** T2 acceptance fails (CRITICAL)  
**If normalization breaks:** Cannot complete T2 (HIGH RISK)  
**If voting abuse prevention breaks:** T3 integrity compromised (HIGH RISK)

**Mitigation:** Test these thoroughly as they're implemented.

---

## 25. RISK REGISTER

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|:-----------:|:------:|-----------|-----------|
| Database redesign needed mid-project | Medium | High | Finalize schema in first 4 hours | Freeze schema, no changes after T1 |
| Judge isolation bugs (hard to catch) | Medium | Critical | Write security tests immediately | Extended T2 testing phase |
| Normalization math wrong | Low | High | Unit test normalization with fixtures | Use simple averaging if time runs out |
| Voting abuse detection insufficient | Low | Medium | Implement rate limiting + duplicates | Disable voting, publish judge results only |
| Docker deployment fails | Low | High | Test locally early and often | Provide manual setup instructions |
| Integration bugs appear late | High | Medium | E2E testing after each tier | Extra 4-6 hour buffer allocated |
| Acceptance suite failures | Medium | High | Run acceptance suite every 12 hours | Fix bugs immediately, do not advance |
| Scope creep (trying to do too much) | High | High | Frozen scope after kickoff, T4 optional | Cut T4 features if T1/T2 at risk |
| Frontend consuming too much time | Medium | Medium | Use simple design, avoid animations | Pre-made component library (Tailwind) |
| Documentation left to the end | High | Medium | Write docs incrementally | Auto-generate some docs from code |

## 29. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Hour 0-2)

### Hour 0 (Project Kickoff)

1. **Assemble Team** (if applicable)
   - Clarify roles (frontend, backend, devops, architecture)
   - Establish communication channels

2. **Read & Understand Brief**
   - Read Dogfood brief completely
   - Read this plan completely
   - Read acceptance suite criteria

3. **Architecture Kickoff Meeting** (30 min)
   - Confirm tech stack choices (Node.js, React, Prisma, SQLite)
   - Discuss architectural decisions (monolith, RBAC, normalization method)
   - Clarify judge isolation requirement
   - Confirm deployment model (Docker Compose)

4. **Create Project Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir dogfood && cd dogfood
   git init
   npm init -y
   npm install express typescript tsx dotenv prisma bcrypt cors helmet
   npm install -D jest ts-jest supertest
   ```

5. **Set Up Git**
   - Create GitHub repo (public, MIT license)
   - Add .gitignore (node_modules, .env, dist, .DS_Store)
   - Initial commit: "initial: project setup"

6. **Create Task Board**
   - Kanban: Not Started | In Progress | Review | Done
   - List all T1, T2, T3 tasks
   - Assign owners (if team > 1)

---

### Hour 1-2 (Foundation)

1. **Database Schema**
   - Create Prisma schema (schema.prisma)
   - Run `prisma migrate dev --name init`
   - Verify tables created

2. **Seed Data Script**
   - Create `seed.ts` with fixture data
   - Run `npm run seed`
   - Verify data in database

3. **Docker Setup**
   - Create Dockerfile
   - Create docker-compose.yml
   - Test: `docker compose up` (should start cleanly)

4. **Git Commit**
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "feat: initial database and docker setup"`
   - `git tag foundation`

---

### Hour 2+ Proceed to T1.0

Follow T1 implementation plan starting with authentication.

---

## 30. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Judge Isolation is Non-Negotiable**
   - Test it early (Hour 25-28)
   - Test it thoroughly (API-level, not frontend)
   - Acceptance suite will specifically check this
   - Cannot advance to T3 if T2 isolation is broken

2. **Normalization Must Be Transparent**
   - Document the math clearly
   - Show before/after results
   - Be able to explain it to non-technical organizers
   - Normalization +5 bonus is valuable if done well

3. **Database Schema Locked After T1.0**
   - Major schema changes mid-project are catastrophic
   - Design schema carefully in first 4 hours
   - All future tiers depend on it
   - Schema upgrades should be backward-compatible

4. **Acceptance Suite is the Source of Truth**
   - Run it every 12 hours
   - Fix failures immediately (do not ignore)
   - Do not claim tiers you haven't verified
   - Overclaiming costs points

5. **Test Judge Isolation at API Level**
   - Cannot rely on frontend hiding endpoints
   - Write tests: Judge A tries to GET /api/scores/judge-b-score-id → 403
   - Include in security test suite
   - Document how it's enforced

6. **Seed Data Must Be Reproducible**
   - Same data every time `docker compose up` runs
   - Allows testing, debugging, and demos
   - Judges can see the system in action immediately
   - Seed must include multiple judges, submissions, scores

7. **Documentation is Part of the Product**
   - Not optional; required for adoption
   - Written incrementally, not at the end
   - README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, JUDGING.md are evaluated
   - Clear == professional == adoptable

8. **Deploy Locally First, Always**
   - Test on clean laptop frequently
   - Catch Docker issues early
   - Ensure no external dependencies
   - `docker compose up` from scratch should work

---

## FINAL CLOSING

This is not a "build it fast" guide. It is a **"build it right, and do it fast"** guide.

The winning project is not the one with the most features. It is the one that:

1. **Actually works** (all tiers stable, not partially)
2. **Is secure** (judge isolation verified, voting integrity proven)
3. **Is understandable** (clear code, good docs)
4. **Can be adopted** (one command to run, no dependencies)
5. **Passes acceptance suite** (honest tier claims)

Quality > quantity.  
Correctness > features.  
Security > speed.  
Maintainability > cleverness.

The organization that wins the right to deploy this platform will use it for their events. They will operate it. They will debug issues. They will extend it. They need software they can trust and understand.

**Build for that organizer. Build for six months from now.**

---

**Document Prepared:** September 21, 2026  
**Hackathon Start:** September 25, 2026 18:00 UTC  
**Submission Deadline:** September 28, 2026 18:00 UTC  

Good luck.
